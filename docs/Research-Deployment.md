# Production, Deployment, and Pipelines
This key first section of my research harbored the majority of my focus on the three (3) key topics of production, deployment, and pipelines.

* Production

Production is the phase of a development lifecycle in which a web application is being built out for the purposes of continuing the process into deployment. Very similar to building out a real bridge in which it connects two (2) land masses. It is that bridge to which represents the real-time bridge between development and deployment to which is the production process.

* Deployment

In my own personal opinion, it is deployment that is a real challenge for me to see through to the very end. The reason behind my fears is the fact that a lot of tweaking to package.json and other areas of the development environment has to be prepared to be ready for deployment. 

* Pipelines

Pipelines are a modern efficient way to streamline the entire deployment process. The process gets done using three (3) primary techniques known as CI, CD, and another CD. These practices are known as Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, or Continuous Deployment. These key techniques in a deployment pipeline are the essence of the modern professional DevOps process.

# The Deployment Process
Below will feature three (3) key concepts related to the following topics that are all integral components to the deployment life cycle a web developer goes through when they follow an application build.

* Production Process 
* CI, Continuous integration

# Deployment Reference Links
This section is a representation of my independent research on the three (3) deployment topics listed below. I found these topics both to be very useful to this course and exceptionally useful.  

Directly below are the resource(s) I found most helpful for this research assignment and why? 


**Resource 1: Continuous integration vs. continuous delivery vs. continuous deployment**  
[CI, CD, and CD?](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment/)

The concepts of CI and CD whether it is continuous delivery or continuous deployment, these are important parts that are inner twined with each other to deliver a successful end result to the development and deployment of a developer's final release of a web application.

The above article's author spoke of these key concepts as a way for a developer to use as a way to simplify or streamline the web deployment life cycle. Below is a visualization of how it conceptually works:

**Resource 2: Continuous Delivery Vs. Continuous Deployment**    
[Continuous, Delivery Vs. Deployment](https://dzone.com/articles/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment-an-ov)

In this research article I observed the author making a viable point that it is commonly mistaken that continuous delivery and continuous deployment are the same thing... This is most certainly not the case. The differences are as follows:

Continuous Delivery is the state of being "at the ready" and able to initiate deployment when needed. No matter what version/build is needed you can deliver it to the users.

Continuous Deployment is exactly how it sounds, a method of physically deploying a current version or build of a developer's web application continuously on a consistent basis so that application users get the most up to date version possible.
