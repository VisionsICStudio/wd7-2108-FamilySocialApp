# WD Portfolio V 

This course will be a continued evolution of my growth as web development student at Full Sail University. The focus is 
on my development of proficient knowledge of the React framework and how to use external APIs to deliver external data
content to the front-end HTML SPA (Single Page Application). This readme file will change as the progression of this 
course changes week by week. 

Markdown files such as these will be used to host my various research data content on a weekly basis, as well as 
deliverable PDF files submitted to FSO. I will use a Docs folder in this repository to hold all the individual 
assignment or research .md files. This repository will include branches that cater to the course topic or assignment
expectation. I plan to use this GitHub repo as a course ecosystem for both application development work and my 
assignmentsas I complete them. A link to these branches will be included in the submission of each assignment and 
or project milestone.

## GitHub Milestones

GitHub Milestones will be used to timeline document each weekly milestone as the expectations of that specific milestone
is completed.

## GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects (similar to that of a Trello board) will be used as the organizational tool of choice to keep track of the 
idea flow aspect of the development of the application as it progresses throughout the course.

## FamilySocial App

 My personal focus as a student for this month will be to deliver a small-scale web application. This will be an expansive 
 blog-like, social-media, and family-focused application that use an external API to feed some of its data content.

 ## Week 1 Project Focus

 At the end of this week I will submit a series of assignments such as a PDF file of my project proposal. The wireframes 
 for the structure of the application. An actual working API call output to a React front-end page. Finally, a video which
 will document and discuss week one work.
